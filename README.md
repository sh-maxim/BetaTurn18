# BetaTurnTool18 and BetaTurnLib18

## Versions

Tool version: 1.1.10
BetaTurnLib18 library version: 1.1
Tool help version: 1.1.10

## Short description

The software tool, BetaTurn18 reads a protein structure in mmCIF or PDB format, locates beta turns and assigns their types using our 2018 library, BetaTurnLib18 with 18 beta-turn types. BetaTurnLib18 includes conformational modes and medoids of 18 beta-turn types. It is provided in 3 formats: a plain-text tab-delimited file, PDF and XLSX spreadsheet.

Both the beta-turn tool and library can be downloaded for further use in third-party tools and software. The tool and library are free, open-source, redistributable and modifiable under BSD 3-Clause License. We adopted the software for 3 operating systems: Unix, Mac and Windows. It automatically downloads required Python tools. The only requirement is to have python2 installed.

## Usage and instructions
